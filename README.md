# About Bloob.io

**Bloob.io** is a project of passion consisting of multiplayer browser games. I started to work on these games aiming to make them fun, configurable, and easily accessible.

# Localization

While the project itself is not open source, the localization is. Feel free to create pull requests with improvements, grammar fixes, or support for new languages.

# FAQ

-   **How do I add a new language?**
    -   Please [make a new issue](https://github.com/Venlious/bloob.io-locale/issues/new) requesting the language you would like to see. If approved, the language will be generated and can then be verified by a person.
-   **I found a grammatically error or spelling mistake. What do I do?**
    -   Great! You can go to the [translation editor](https://bloob.io/translation-editor) and find and fix the issue there, resolve the issue in the repository directly, or you can [make a new issue](https://github.com/Venlious/bloob.io-locale/issues/new) with an explanation of the error you found.
-   **I have another question!**
    -   Feel free to [make a new issue](https://github.com/Venlious/bloob.io-locale/issues/new) with your question.

# Local Setup

Running the project locally is easy. Please make sure to use [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

-   Install all files
    `bun install`
-   Translate (new) language (Note: must configure .env)
    `bun translate --source "en" --target "nl" --language "informal Dutch"`
-   Automatically fix any fixable and common issues
    `bun fix`
-   Automatically fix and fill any translations that are missing (Note: must configure .env)
    `bun fill`
-   Verify if test passes
    `bun test`
-   Verify if lint passes
    `bun lint`

You're now good to go. There's no build process. Use `bun lint:fix` to automatically fix any formatting and linting errors.
